1. Launched in the United States on March 17, 1958 under the International Geophysical Year program. The satellite had a mass of 1474 grams at launch. The satellite became the second American spacecraft in space. But a sufficiently high orbit provided him with a much longer life. It is still in orbit, 60 years after launch. This satellite, due to its relatively large mass, is a great threat in space. It is the oldest man-made object in near-earth space.
2. Fēngyún, abbreviated as FY, are China's meteorological satellites. China has been launching meteorological satellites in polar and geosynchronous orbit since 1988. On January 11, 2007, China destroyed one of these satellites (FY-1C) during an anti-satellite missile test. According to NASA, the deliberate destruction of the FY-1C generated 2,841 high-speed debris objects, which is more dangerous space debris than any other space mission in history.
3. At the height of the Cold War, all international communications were either sent through undersea cables or bounced off the natural ionosphere. The United States Military was concerned that the Soviets might cut those cables, forcing the unpredictable ionosphere to be the only means of communication with overseas forces.To mitigate the potential threat, a ring of 480,000,000 copper dipole antennas were placed in orbit to facilitate global radio communication. The dipoles collectively provided passive support to Project Westford's parabolic dish to communicate with distant sites. The needles were placed in medium Earth orbit at an altitude of between 3,500 and 3,800 kilometers at inclinations of 96 and 87 degrees. They have contributed to Earth's orbital debris.
4. On February 10, 2009, two communications satellites—the active commercial Iridium 33 and the derelict Russian military Kosmos-2251—accidentally collided at a speed of 11,700 m/s and an altitude of 789 kilometres above the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia. It was the first time a hypervelocity collision occurred between two satellites – until then, all accidental hypervelocity collisions had involved a satellite and a piece of space debris.By December 2011, many pieces of the debris were in an observable orbital decay towards Earth, and were expected to burn up in the atmosphere within one to two years. By January 2014, 24% of the known debris had actually decayed. In 2016, Space News listed the collision as the second biggest fragmentation event in history, with Kosmos-2251 and Iridium 33 producing respectively 1,668 and 628 pieces of catalogued debris, of which 1,141 and 364 pieces of tracked debris remain in orbit as of January 2016
5. Starlink is a satellite internet constellation being constructed by SpaceX providing satellite Internet access. The recent launch of the first 60 “Starlink” satellites has sparked outrage on social media. Some critics claim the “mega-constellation” of satellites by the U.S. company SpaceX will increase the risk of creating more space junk, even calling it a threat to space flight itself. Such space debris can affect the collision of satellites with it, which will lead to tragedy and the appearance of new space debris. Elon Musk and his company SpaceX created innovative solutions to the problems of faster internet, but in the end they created more innovative problems, perhaps he created problems in order to solve them in the future.
6. Kessler's syndrome (effect) is a theoretical development of events in near-earth orbit, when space debris resulting from numerous launches of artificial satellites makes near space completely unusable for practical use. For the first time such a scenario was described in detail by NASA consultant Donald KesslerAccording to NASA models, in low Earth orbit (altitude 200-2000 km), since 2007 there have been enough large debris and satellites for the onset of the syndrome. According to calculations, on average, large collisions will occur every five years, even if space launches are completely stopped, and the amount of debris will grow.
