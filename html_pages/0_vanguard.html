          <p>
              Launched in the United States on March 17, 1958 under the International Geophysical Year program. The satellite had a mass of 1474 grams at launch. The satellite became the second American spacecraft in space. But a sufficiently high orbit provided him with a much longer life. It is still in orbit, 60 years after launch. This satellite, due to its relatively large mass, is a great threat in space. It is the oldest man-made object in near-earth space.
