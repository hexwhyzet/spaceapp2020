              Kessler's syndrome (effect) is a theoretical development of events in near-earth orbit, when space debris resulting from numerous launches of artificial satellites makes near space completely unusable for practical use. For the first time such a scenario was described in detail by NASA consultant Donald KesslerAccording to NASA models, in low Earth orbit (altitude 200-2000 km), since 2007 there have been enough large debris and satellites for the onset of the syndrome. According to calculations, on average, large collisions will occur every five years, even if space launches are completely stopped, and the amount of debris will grow.
